# Ezra Full Stack developer test done using REACT

## Completed Tasks

### Front end

1. `render` and `addMember` completed
2. `editMember` and `deleteMember` methods completed

### Back end

1. Endpoints to add, delete, and to update a member completed
2. Completed `AddMember`, `UpdateMember` and `DeleteMember` methods in `api/DB/MembersRepository`

### Misc

1. Fixed the small bug in `api/DB/MembersRepository.cs` where ExecuteNonQuery had a return type when it should return void.


## Notes

- Updating members works for new members I added but will not work on pre-existing members in the DB
- Overall not too difficult but I got stumped on certain parts due to my unfamiliarity with React (chose React due to not being familiar with Angular or Vue)
- Spent ~6 hours (coding and debugging time)
- Did not where to run the SQL script to reset the DB
